# Task {{TASK_ID}}: {{TASK_NAME}}

**Project:** {{PROJECT_NAME}}
**Created:** {{DATE}}
**Status:** active

## Goal

> One clear sentence: what does completing this task achieve?

## Context

- Tech stack: {{TECH_STACK}}
- Related ADRs: `docs/architecture/decisions/`
- Dependencies: none (or list task IDs this depends on)

## Requirements

> Link acceptance criteria to requirement IDs for traceability. Use the format `REQ-NNN` where NNN matches the feature or spec area. This lets you trace from requirement → task → test spec → code.

| Req ID | Description | Priority |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| REQ-001 | | must have |
| | | |

## Readiness gate

Before writing any code, verify:

- [ ] Test spec `{{TASK_ID}}-{{TASK_SLUG}}-test-spec.md` exists in `docs/tasks/test-specs/`
- [ ] All acceptance criteria below have a linked REQ ID
- [ ] Any blocking tasks are complete

## Acceptance criteria

> Each criterion should reference its requirement: `[REQ-001]` description of what done looks like.

- [ ] [REQ-001]
- [ ]

## Verification plan

> **How will we know this works in the running binary?** Fill this in *before* writing code — not after. A task that can't articulate this up-front cannot be marked ✅ later. See `docs/tasks/test-specs/coverage-tracker.md` for the full verification ladder.

> Pick the highest level that genuinely covers this task and write the exact evidence you expect to produce:

- **Highest level achievable:** L<N> — <one-line reason>
- **Level 5 — Validation harness command (if applicable):**
  ```
  <exact command, e.g. cargo test --release --test e2e_orb -- --ignored>
  ```
  Expected final assertion: `<what the harness will print on success>`
- **Level 6 — Operator observation (if applicable):**
  - Binary path: `<command to run the relevant binary>`
  - Targeted behaviour to observe: `<what should appear in stdout / logs / UI>`
- **Cross-module state risk:** <none | names the new field/queue/event/etc. — the executor must produce a producer-consumer trace>
- **Runtime-visible surface:** <none | logging | CLI | TUI | endpoint | file output — the executor must run the binary and quote output>

If the task is a pure internal refactor with no runtime-observable surface and no cross-module state, write *"L2 only — internal refactor, unit-test-covered"* and explain why ✅ at L2 is appropriate here.

## Out of scope

> What this task deliberately does NOT cover. Helps keep it atomic.

## Notes

> Any context useful for Claude or future collaborators — decisions made, gotchas, links.
